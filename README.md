Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Firebase Account: You must have a Firebase account to use Firebase Authentication and Realtime Database.

If you donâ€™t have one, create a Firebase project: Firebase Console

Set up Authentication, Database, and obtain the Firebase config for your project.

Basic Knowledge:

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are required to understand and modify the game.

Firebase setup knowledge will be helpful to link the game to your Firebase project.

Steps to Get Started
Clone the Repository (or create your own files):

Create an empty folder for your project.

Save the provided index.html and style.css files into that folder.

Firebase Setup:

Go to your Firebase Console and create a new project.

Enable Firebase Authentication (Email/Password).

Set up Firebase Realtime Database and set read/write rules to public for testing.

Get your Firebase config (as shown in the firebaseConfig object in the index.html file).

Replace Firebase Config:

Replace the firebaseConfig in index.html with your own Firebase project details.

javascript
Copier
Modifier
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "YOUR_API_KEY",
  authDomain: "YOUR_AUTH_DOMAIN",
  databaseURL: "YOUR_DATABASE_URL",
  projectId: "YOUR_PROJECT_ID",
  storageBucket: "YOUR_STORAGE_BUCKET",
  messagingSenderId: "YOUR_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID",
  appId: "YOUR_APP_ID",
  measurementId: "YOUR_MEASUREMENT_ID"
};
Run the Game:

Open index.html in your browser.

You can now log in, sign up, and interact with the game.

To test the gameâ€™s multiplayer functionality, open multiple browser windows (or use different devices) to simulate multiple players.

Features in Detail
Authentication
Login & Signup: Players can sign up or log in with their email and password using Firebase Authentication.

Error Handling: Displays error messages for invalid credentials or other login issues.

Friends System
Add Friends: Players can add friends using their email address. This adds the friendâ€™s email to the Firebase Realtime Database.

View Friends List: Displays a list of friends the player has added.

Game Features
Private Match Creation: Players can create private games and share match codes.

Player Movement: The player can move within the game canvas using the arrow keys.

Player Stats: Displays player stats such as health, coins, and kills.

Shop System
Buy Guns & Power-ups: Players can purchase guns and power-ups from the shop using coins.

Gun Purchases: Guns will be added to the player's inventory upon purchase.

Game UI
Sleek UI: The interface includes a clean and modern design with buttons for each functionality (login, join game, add friends, etc.).

Canvas: The game area is displayed in a canvas, where the player's character is represented by a blue square.

Firebase Rules (For Testing)
To allow the game to read and write data to Firebase during testing, you can temporarily set the Firebase Realtime Database rules to public.

Open Firebase Console > Database > Rules.

Set the rules like this:

json
Copier
Modifier
{
  "rules": {
    ".read": "auth != null",
    ".write": "auth != null"
  }
}
For production, you should adjust these rules to only allow authenticated users to read/write their data.

Next Steps for Further Development
Matchmaking System: Implement a matchmaking system that allows players to automatically join games or create new ones.

Chat System: Add a real-time chat system that allows players to communicate with each other in-game.

Leaderboards: Implement a leaderboard system that tracks players' kills and other stats across matches.

Shooting & Combat: Add shooting mechanics, health updates, and collision detection for player combat.

Game World: Add more features like gun models, actual player avatars, and environmental interactions.
